======

DSL for functional embedded device operational specifications using integer arithmetic and past time operators.

Example:
```
changed? := \x -> x /= old x;

changedTo? := \what -> \to -> changed? what && what == to;

ioEvent? := \n -> \m -> \v -> 
    (input:n & m) == m 
     && (input:n & m) == m;

button1Pressed := ioEvent? 1 512 1;     
button1Released := ioEvent? 1 512 0;

timeWhenPressed := time: when button1Pressed;
timeWhenReleased := time: when button1Released;

pressed3Seconds := timeWhenReleased - timeWhenPressed > 3;
pressed3Seconds -> alarm 1;
